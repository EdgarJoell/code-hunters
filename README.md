# Code Hunters

## Purpose

The whole purpose behind Code Hunters is for me to log and as well as "blog post" certain issues I come across while on my programming journey. There have been plenty of times when I am coding that I'm searching for a problem that is VERY specific that Stack Overflow and other code helping resources either haven't mentioned it and have a question posted but nobody had answered it. 

I'm striving to use Code Hunters as my own Stack Overflow to document my problems and my solutions that I find. If this helps other people, then that would be absolutely amazing.

## Technologies
With Code Hunters, I'll be building it with React and Vite for my front-end and C# with ASP.NET as my back-end. Both technologies that i am familiar with but Code Hunters will be where I truly learn and dive head first into these technologies for my own personal knowledge and to add them into my skill set. 

## Conclusion
This project, once it has sufficient work put into it, will be hosted right here on GitHub as a Single-Page Application for others to see and use and hopefully this can bring you the solution you were looking for :)

I plan on someday releasing this as a product where others can contribute the problems that they had on post how they came to figuring it out. 

Happy Coding!
